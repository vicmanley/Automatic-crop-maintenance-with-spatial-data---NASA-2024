# Automatic-crop-maintenance-with-spatial-data---NASA-2024
Development of an automated system that uses NASA satellite data to monitor precipitation, humidity, and vegetation in agricultural areas. With a mobile app, drone control, and a central panel, it enables the management of irrigation, drainage, and seed dispersal, optimizing crops efficiently and accessibly

## THE CHALLENGE
Farmers around the world grapple with a myriad of challenges that threaten their livelihoods and food security. These challenges include unpredictable weather patterns that disrupt planting and harvesting schedules, pest infestations that damage crops, outbreaks of diseases that affect livestock, and even political tensions that impact trade and access to essential resources. These factors collectively contribute to the vulnerability of agricultural communities by impacting crop health, profitability, and overall sustainability.
